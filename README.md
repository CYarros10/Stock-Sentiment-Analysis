# Stock Sentiment Analysis

Script to pull price history, twitter sentiment, and google trend scores about a specific stock ticker. Used as a practice opportunity to learn more about Python, APIs, and cx_Oracle database library.

## Getting Started

stockAnalysis.py is the main script to run. The individual pieces of this script are located in a separate folder.


### Prerequisites

Ideally, one must have an oracle database to store the data that is pulled. However, there are options to save data as a CSV to be evaluated at a later time.

### Future Work

Goals for future work include:

* Collecting large amounts of data to run deeper analysis on
* Utilize machine learning to create predictive models for stock ticker prices
* Progress towards cryptocurrency support
